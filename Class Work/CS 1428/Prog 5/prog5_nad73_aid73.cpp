 This program reads an unknown number of simple binary expressions
 of the form 'operand1 operator operand2' from an input file. Each
 expression is evaluated. Real input values are allowed.
 
 A sentinel value read loop is used to process as described below:
 
 (Named constants to 'hold' CLASS ("C.S.1428") and DUE_DATE ("--/--/--")
 are declared in the calling routine (main).)
 
 - A void function, getName, is called to 'get' the team members' first & last
 names using two different prompts for each team member leaving a blank
 line between sets of prompts. Four strings, one to 'hold' the first name
 and one to 'hold' the last name for each team member, are declared in the
 calling routine. A blank line is left after the last prompt.
 - A typed function, getLectureSection, is called to 'get' the team members'
 three-digit lecture section number. A string to 'hold' the lecture
 section number is declared in the calling routine. A blank line is left
 after the prompt.
 - A void function, getLabSection, is called to 'get' the team members'
 two-digit lab section numbers using two separate prompts. Strings are
 declared in the calling routine to 'hold' the lab section numbers.
 - A void function, printIdInfo, is called to print the team members' personal
 identifying information to the output file. (Refer to the sample output
 below.)
 - A void function, readExpression, is called to read from an input file
 a binary expression in the form operand1 operator operand2. One read
 statement is used to "get" the parts of the expression.
 - While the operator in the expression read is not a question mark,
 the program processes as follows:
 - A void function, echoExpression, is called to echo (print)
 the expression to the output file.
 - A void function, evaluateExpression, is called. If the
 expression currently being evaluated is valid, the results
 are calculated and written to the output file; otherwise,
 an appropriate message is written to the output file. (See
 below. *) A switch is used in the solution.
 - The void function readExpression is called to read the next
 expression of the form operand1 operator operand2.
 - Two blank lines are written to the screen in the calling routine before
 the void function printIdInfo is called to print the team members' personal
 identifying information to the console. (Refer to the sample output
 below.)
 - A void function, writeFileLocation, is called to print an appropriate
 message to the screen indicating to the user the name of the output
 file to which the results have been written. (Refer to sample output
 below.)
 
 ==========================================================================
 
 *The expressions are checked for the addition (+), subtraction (-),
 multiplication (*), and division (/) operators. Included are a check for
 division by zero when the division operator is encountered and a check for
 an invalid operator (e.g. 134.6 ! 23.1). Since these are mutually exclusive
 events, a switch statement with a nested double-sided alternative for
 handling the division operator was used to evaluate the expressions.
 
 If division by zero is encountered, the original expression is echoed to
 the output file along with the message '   Division by zero produces an
 undefined result.' If an invalid operator is encountered, the original
 expression is echoed to the output file along with the message
 '   Encountered unknown operator.'
 
 Every attempt is made to eliminate repetitive code!
 
 Numeric values in output are NOT formatted!
 
 ==========================================================================
 
 The layout and content of the file input and the file output are shown in
 the samples below. An appropriate message is displayed to the screen if
 either the input file or the output file fails to open.
 
 Input (file - prog5_?inp.txt):  // '?' represents three-digit lecture number
